# Fcbarcelona-Website
Website for FC Barcelona sports club
I asked to make a website using HTML, CSS, javascript, and PHP for my College so I decided to make
The website for Barcelona inspired my imagination from the color of the Logo, country, and the Official website itself
To open the website you have to download the wamp server and put the file in the directory 'www' then open it like that 
localhost/filename
for displaying images download them from here and put them with the file
